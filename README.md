A complete pytorch implementation of skipgram model (with subsampling and negative sampling).
The embedding result is tested with Spearman's rank correlation.

I forked this library to implement the possiblity to initialise the embeddings with pre-trained vectors and to have different vocab sizes for in- and output.
